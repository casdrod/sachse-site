            <p>This is a passion project created and maintained by myself, a fellow Sachse resident and local web developer. I saw where the city's website could be improved
                and added features and content that I would like it to have, so I created my own website. This is a custom project I've taken on to enrich the city that
                 I live in: Sachse, Texas. The site strives to serve as a central hub which aggregates data from numerous other sources including alerts from the police 
                 department, news, events, trash pickup information, and jobs through custom web scrapers built specifically for each . The purpose is to provide a more intimate and holistic view of the goings on in the city while avoiding some of the less productive features of 
                 something like a social media site.</p>
