## About The Project
This is a project I've chosen to take on to enrich the city that I live in: Sachse, Texas. The site strives to serva as a central hub which compiles data from numerous other sources including alerts from the police department, news, events, bulk trash pickup information, and jobs through custom web scrapers written specifically for each task. The scraped data is stored in a local MongoDB databse for sake of redundancy, performance, and to safeguard against the possibility of the scrapers themselves becoming outdated over time. The purpose is to provide a more intimate and holistic view of the goings on in the city while avoiding some of the less productive features of something like a social media site. The first iteration of the site is due to go live 03/24/23 as completion of the majority of scrapers and front-end nears completion.
